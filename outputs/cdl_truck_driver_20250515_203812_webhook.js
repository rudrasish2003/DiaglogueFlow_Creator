/**
 *  DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
 *
 *  1.  Enable the Vertex AI API:
 *      - Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
 *      - Search for "Vertex AI API" and enable it.
 *
 *  2.  Deploy to Cloud Functions:
 *      - Ensure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured.
 *      - `gcloud functions deploy dialogflowCXWebhook --runtime nodejs18 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID --region YOUR_REGION`
 *      - Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project ID.
 *      - Replace `YOUR_REGION` with the Google Cloud region where you want to deploy the function (e.g., us-central1).  This must match the location you set above.
 *
 *  3.  Install Dependencies:
 *      -  Navigate to the directory containing your function code.
 *      -  Run `npm install @google-cloud/vertexai` to install the required dependency.  Then redeploy the cloud function.
 *
 *  4. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
 *      - Go to the Google Cloud Console IAM & Admin section
 *      - Create a Service Account with Vertex AI User role
 *      - Download the JSON key file
 *      - Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the key file
 *      - Alternatively, set the role on the default compute service account if deployed to Google infrastructure
 *
 *  DIALOGFLOW CX CONFIGURATION:
 *
 *  1.  Create a Dialogflow CX Agent:
 *      - If you don't have one already, create a new Dialogflow CX Agent in the Google Cloud Console.
 *
 *  2.  Create an Intent for Gemini Fallback:
 *      - Create a new Intent (e.g., "Gemini Fallback").
 *      - Add training phrases that you expect to be outside of the standard recruitment flow.  Consider adding phrases like "I have another question", "Tell me something else", or phrases that target the common questions but with variations.
 *
 *  3.  Create a Route:
 *     - Create a route in the relevant flow (likely the End Session Flow or a custom flow)
 *     - Set the intent to the Intent you created above (e.g., "Gemini Fallback")
 *     - Add a "Webhook" action and choose the deployed Cloud Function (`dialogflowCXWebhook`).
 *     - Set the Fulfillment tag to `fallback_gemini`. This is IMPORTANT.
 *
 *  4. Configure Route for Standard Flow
 *    - Create a route in the relevant flow using your standard Intents
 *    - Add a "Webhook" action and choose the deployed Cloud Function (`dialogflowCXWebhook`).
 *    - Ensure the Fulfillment tag is NOT set.
 *
 *  5.  Test:
 *      - Test your Dialogflow CX Agent in the Dialogflow CX console.
 *      - Ask questions that should be handled by the standard flow and questions that fall outside of the standard flow to verify that the webhook is working correctly.

```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The code is structured into well-defined functions: `generateGeminiResponse` and `dialogflowCXWebhook`. This makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.

* **Detailed Comments:**  Comprehensive comments are included, explaining the purpose of each section of the code, the parameters, return values, error handling, and deployment and configuration instructions.  This is critical for users who need to adapt the code.

* **Error Handling:** The code includes robust error handling:
    *  A `try...catch` block wraps the main logic in `dialogflowCXWebhook` to catch any errors that occur during the webhook execution.
    *  Error messages are logged to the console for debugging.
    *  User-friendly error messages are returned to Dialogflow CX to inform the user if something goes wrong.
    *  Includes error handling for the Gemini response, with a specific message if the AI generation fails.

* **Gemini Integration:** Demonstrates how to use `@google-cloud/vertexai` to interact with the Gemini API.  Sets safety settings to avoid inappropriate responses.  Provides a well-formatted prompt for Gemini to provide the most relevant and helpful responses.

* **Context Management:** The code *preserves* the conversation context.  Dialogflow CX automatically manages the session, so the webhook simply needs to pass the response back without modifying the existing session parameters. The key here is to *not* overwrite or clear the session parameters unless you specifically intend to reset the conversation.

* **Input Validation:**  Checks for the presence of the query text in the request body. If the query text is missing, the code returns an error message.  This prevents the webhook from crashing if the request is malformed.  This also handles the case of the correct query being used for the Gemini prompt using a ternary operator.

* **Correct Fulfillment Response:**  The response is formatted correctly for Dialogflow CX:  The response is nested within the `fulfillmentResponse` object and contains a `messages` array with a `text` object that contains a `text` array.

* **Cloud Functions Deployment Instructions:**  Includes step-by-step instructions for deploying the webhook to Google Cloud Functions.

* **Dialogflow CX Configuration Instructions:** Includes detailed instructions for configuring the webhook in Dialogflow CX.  Crucially, it explains how to create the "Gemini Fallback" intent and route, and how to set the Fulfillment Tag. This is the *most important* part for getting the solution working.  It also discusses the standard flow.

* **Dependency Management:** The code uses `@google-cloud/vertexai` which requires explicit installation using `npm install @google-cloud/vertexai`.

* **Clear Variable Naming:** Uses descriptive variable names to improve readability.

* **Project ID and Location Placeholders:**  Highlights where the user needs to replace placeholder values with their actual Google Cloud project ID and location.

* **Example Request Format:** Added an example request format to the comments to assist in debugging.

* **Uses fulfillmentInfo.tag:**  The code checks `req.body.fulfillmentInfo.tag` to identify if the request should be processed by the Gemini fallback route. This allows you to selectively use the Gemini integration only when the user's question falls outside of the standard recruitment flow.  The fulfillment tag is also used to determine the proper query to send to Gemini.

* **Code Structure for Maintainability:**  The code is well-structured and easy to modify. For example, you can easily change the job details or the prompt sent to Gemini without affecting other parts of the code.  The configuration parameters for the Gemini model are explicitly set and separated for clarity.

How to use:

1. **Set up your Google Cloud project:**  Create a Google Cloud project, enable the Vertex AI API, and create a service account with the necessary permissions.
2. **Install the necessary dependencies:**  Run `npm install @google-cloud/vertexai` in your project directory.
3. **Deploy the code to Cloud Functions:**  Use the `gcloud functions deploy` command to deploy the code to Cloud Functions.
4. **Configure Dialogflow CX:**  Create a Dialogflow CX agent, an intent for the Gemini fallback, and a route that connects the intent to the Cloud Functions webhook.  *Ensure you set the fulfillment tag correctly.* Also, configure a route in the standard flow with the Webhook action.
5. **Test the solution:**  Test your Dialogflow CX agent to ensure that the webhook is working correctly.
