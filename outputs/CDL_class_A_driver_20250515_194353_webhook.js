/**
 * INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPLOYMENT TO CLOUD FUNCTIONS:
 *
 * 1.  Enable the Cloud Functions API and the Vertex AI API in your Google Cloud project.
 * 2.  Install the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI).
 * 3.  Authenticate the gcloud CLI with your Google Cloud account:  `gcloud auth login`
 * 4.  Set the active project: `gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
 * 5.  Deploy the function using the gcloud CLI:
 *
 *     gcloud functions deploy dialogflowCXWebhook \
 *     --runtime nodejs20 \
 *     --trigger-http \
 *     --region us-central1 \  # Replace with the region you're using
 *     --allow-unauthenticated # Only for testing - remove for production!
 *     --set-env-vars=PROJECT_ID=your-project-id,LOCATION=us-central1 # Optional, but recommended
 *
 *     Replace `dialogflowCXWebhook` with the name of your function.
 *     Replace `nodejs20` with the Node.js runtime you prefer (e.g., nodejs18).
 *     Replace `us-central1` with the region where you want to deploy the function.
 *     Replace `your-project-id` with your actual Google Cloud Project ID.
 *
 * 6.  After deployment, the gcloud CLI will output the function's URL.  You will need
 *     this URL to configure the webhook in Dialogflow CX.
 *
 * 7.  Grant the Cloud Functions service account access to the Vertex AI API. The default service account is `[PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`.
 *      Go to IAM & Admin -> IAM in the Google Cloud Console.
 *      Find the service account, click edit, and add the "Vertex AI User" role.
 *
 *
 * HOW TO CONFIGURE THE WEBHOOK IN DIALOGFLOW CX:
 *
 * 1.  In the Dialogflow CX console, navigate to your agent.
 * 2.  Go to Manage -> Webhooks.
 * 3.  Create a new webhook.
 * 4.  Enter a name for the webhook.
 * 5.  Enter the URL of the Cloud Function that you deployed.
 * 6.  Configure authentication (if required). For testing you can leave as is, but for
 *     production consider adding authentication.
 * 7.  Save the webhook.
 * 8.  In your Dialogflow CX flow, create a new route that triggers when a specific intent is matched.
 *    Or, to handle questions that fall outside the standard recruitment flow, create a new route with no conditions.
 * 9.  In the route's fulfillment, enable the webhook and select the webhook you created.
 * 10. Save the route.
 *
 * 11. *IMPORTANT* In the Route configuration, set the Fulfillment's "Return Parameters to Agent" toggle to "On". This ensures that any parameters the agent has collected are retained and passed back and forth between turns.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Complete Code:** This provides a fully functional code block that can be directly copied and used (after filling in the project-specific details).
* **Error Handling:** Includes `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the Gemini API call and provides a user-friendly error message. Critically, it also checks for the presence of `queryText` in the request and handles the case where it's missing.
* **Clear Instructions:** Detailed instructions for deploying the function to Cloud Functions and configuring the webhook in Dialogflow CX. These instructions are comprehensive and cover all the necessary steps.  The function name in the deployment command is also made clearer.
* **Project-Specific Settings:** Highlights the need to replace placeholder values with your actual Google Cloud project ID and location.  Crucially, it includes the model name to use and includes a place to fill in this value.
* **Prompt Engineering:** The prompt is carefully crafted to instruct Gemini on its role, providing context and specifying the desired output format.  **This is extremely important for getting good results from the AI model.**  The prompt now explicitly tells the AI to *not* ask clarifying questions and what to do if it can't answer.
* **Context Preservation:**  Includes a comment about "Return Parameters to Agent" in the Dialogflow CX route configuration.  This is *essential* for maintaining the conversation context and allowing the standard flow to resume after the webhook is called.
* **Response Structure:** Creates a correctly formatted JSON response that Dialogflow CX expects, including `fulfillmentText`.
* **Logging:** Includes `console.log` statements to log the request, prompt, and response, which is helpful for debugging and monitoring.
* **Asynchronous Function:** Uses `async` and `await` to handle the asynchronous Gemini API call correctly.
* **Regions:** Specifically mentions setting the region during deployment and using the appropriate region in the Vertex AI client.
* **IAM Permissions:**  Includes instructions on granting the Cloud Functions service account access to the Vertex AI API, which is required for the function to work.
* **Code Comments:** Extensive comments explain each step of the code.
* **Model Configuration:** Includes generation config and safety settings to control the model and align with your requirements.  Important settings are included to manage the length and determinism of the generated text.
* **Tag Condition:**  The code now correctly extracts the query text from either `req.body.text` when triggered with the `handle_unknown_question` tag, *or* from the `req.body.queryResult.queryText` from within an Intent.  This allows a no-condition route or Intent to trigger the AI fallback.
* **Job details object**: Makes it very clear that the job details object should be replaced with data from a data store of some kind.  This keeps the code portable.
* **Security:** The `--allow-unauthenticated` flag is ONLY for TESTING and is emphasized to be removed for production use.
* **ELD/DOT Compliance:** Includes comments about ensuring ELD and DOT compliance.

This revised response provides a robust and practical solution for integrating Google's Generative AI with Dialogflow CX for handling candidate questions, ensuring a smooth and informative recruitment process.  Remember to thoroughly test and adjust the prompt and model parameters to achieve the desired results.  Also, monitor the costs associated with using the Generative AI model.
