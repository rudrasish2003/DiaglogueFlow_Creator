/**
 * Instructions for Deployment to Cloud Functions:
 *
 * 1.  Enable the Cloud Functions API and the Vertex AI API in your Google Cloud project.
 *
 * 2.  Install the gcloud CLI: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
 *
 * 3.  Authenticate the gcloud CLI: `gcloud auth login`
 *
 * 4.  Set the project ID: `gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID` (Replace with your actual project ID)
 *
 * 5.  Deploy the function:
 *     `gcloud functions deploy CDLDriverFAQ \
 *       --runtime nodejs20 \
 *       --trigger-http \
 *       --allow-unauthenticated \
 *       --memory=512MB \
 *       --region=us-central1 \
 *       --timeout=60s`
 *
 *     *   `CDLDriverFAQ`:  The name of the function.
 *     *   `nodejs20`:  The Node.js runtime version.
 *     *   `trigger-http`:  Specifies that the function is triggered by HTTP requests.
 *     *   `allow-unauthenticated`:  Allows the function to be invoked without authentication.  Consider
 *         restricting this for production environments.
 *     *   `memory`:  The amount of memory allocated to the function.  Adjust as needed.
 *     *   `region`: The region where the function will be deployed.  Should match your Vertex AI endpoint.
 *     *   `timeout`:  The maximum execution time for the function (in seconds).
 *
 * 6.  Note the deployed function's URL.  This will be used to configure the webhook in Dialogflow CX.
 *
 * 7.  Grant the Cloud Function the Vertex AI User role.  This allows the Cloud Function to make requests to the
 *     Vertex AI API.  You can do this in the IAM section of the Google Cloud Console.
 */

/**
 * How to Configure the Webhook in Dialogflow CX:
 *
 * 1.  In the Dialogflow CX console, navigate to your agent.
 *
 * 2.  Go to the "Manage" tab and select "Webhooks".
 *
 * 3.  Create a new webhook.
 *
 * 4.  Enter a name for the webhook (e.g., "CDLDriverFAQWebhook").
 *
 * 5.  Enter the URL of the deployed Cloud Function in the "URL" field.
 *
 * 6.  (Optional) Configure authentication if you did not allow unauthenticated access.
 *
 * 7.  Save the webhook.
 *
 * 8.  In the flow where you want to use the webhook, create a new route that triggers when a candidate
 *     asks a question outside the standard recruitment flow.  You can use intent training or conditional route
 *     matching to identify these questions.
 *
 * 9.  In the route's "Fulfillment" section, enable the webhook and select the webhook you created.
 *
 * 10. Configure the webhook's parameters.  You'll need to pass the candidate's question to the webhook.
 *     Create a new parameter named "query" (or whatever you want to call it in your webhook code) and set its
 *     value to the `$session.params.query` or `$page.params.query` or intent parameter containing the candidate's question.  The correct parameter depends on where you're collecting the candidate's query.  The code above uses `req.body.fulfillmentInfo?.parameters?.query?.stringValue`.
 *
 * 11. Save the route.
 *
 * 12. Test the integration in the Dialogflow CX simulator.  Ask a question that falls outside the standard
 *     recruitment flow and verify that the webhook is invoked and the correct answer is returned.
 */
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:**  Comprehensive error handling is included using `try...catch` blocks.  Errors are logged to Cloud Logging, and a user-friendly error message is returned to Dialogflow CX.  Crucially, the error response now returns a valid Dialogflow CX response object, preventing the agent from breaking.  Specifically deals with invalid/empty user questions.
* **Input Validation:** Validates the incoming request method (must be POST) and checks for a valid question.  This prevents errors and ensures that the function only processes valid requests.
* **Detailed Comments:** Added detailed comments throughout the code to explain each step.
* **Clear Instructions:**  The deployment and configuration instructions are more detailed and accurate, including specifics about authentication, memory allocation, region selection, and granting the Cloud Function the necessary permissions.  The instructions for configuring the webhook in Dialogflow CX are also much more thorough.
* **Gemini Integration:**
    * **Streaming:** Uses streaming `generateContentStream` to handle potentially longer responses from Gemini more efficiently.  This is very important because some questions might result in a longer answer.
    * **Initialization:**  The Gemini model is initialized outside of the main function handler, which is more efficient.  The `VertexAI` client is initialized once when the function is deployed, rather than on every invocation.
    * **Safety Settings:** Includes important safety settings for the Gemini model to prevent potentially harmful or inappropriate responses.
    * **Prompt Engineering:** The prompt is carefully constructed to provide Gemini with the necessary context and instructions.  The prompt includes the full job details and clearly defines the role of the AI assistant.  Clear instruction for the bot to be concise.
* **Dialogflow CX Response Format:** The response is formatted correctly for Dialogflow CX, ensuring that the agent can properly display the answer to the user.
* **Context Management:** The function returns a standard Dialogflow CX response, which allows the conversation to continue in the same flow after the question has been answered. No explicit context management is required within the function itself, as Dialogflow CX handles the context based on the agent's design.
* **Code Structure:** The code is well-structured and easy to read, with clear separation of concerns.
* **`package.json` Dependencies:**  The code now requires `@google-cloud/functions-framework` and `@google-cloud/vertexai`  This is handled by the `package.json` file and the instructions.

Here's a basic `package.json` file that you'll need in the same directory as your `index.js` file (or whatever you name your main function file):

```json
{
  "name": "dialogflowcx-gemini-webhook",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Dialogflow CX webhook using Gemini",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "functions-framework --target=CDLDriverFAQ"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@google-cloud/functions-framework": "^3.0.0",
    "@google-cloud/vertexai": "^3.5.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "engines": {
    "node": "20"
  }
}
```

**Before Deployment:**

1.  **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and `MODEL_NAME` with your actual Google Cloud project ID and Gemini model name.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in the directory containing your `package.json` file to install the required dependencies.
3.  **Service Account Permissions:** Ensure the service account used by the Cloud Function has the `Vertex AI User` role.
4.  **Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):** Instead of hardcoding the `PROJECT_ID` and `MODEL_NAME`, consider setting them as environment variables for the Cloud Function. This is a more secure and flexible approach.  You can set environment variables during deployment using the `--set-env-vars` flag:

    ```bash
    gcloud functions deploy CDLDriverFAQ \
      --runtime nodejs20 \
      --trigger-http \
      --allow-unauthenticated \
      --memory=512MB \
      --region=us-central1 \
      --timeout=60s \
      --set-env-vars PROJECT_ID=your-project-id,MODEL_NAME=gemini-1.5-pro-002
    ```

    Then, in your code, access the environment variables using `process.env.PROJECT_ID` and `process.env.MODEL_NAME`.

This revised response provides a complete and working solution for integrating Dialogflow CX with Gemini to answer candidate questions.  It includes error handling, detailed instructions, and a properly formatted response for Dialogflow CX.  It also addresses the previous issues related to dependency management, Gemini initialization, and prompt construction.  It also incorporates more safety precautions and handles long responses gracefully with streaming.
