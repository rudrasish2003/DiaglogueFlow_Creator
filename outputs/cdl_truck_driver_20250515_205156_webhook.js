/*
DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Enable the Cloud Functions and Vertex AI API:
    -   Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
    -   Search for "Cloud Functions" and enable the API.
    -   Search for "Vertex AI" and enable the API.

2.  Create a Google Cloud Function:
    -   Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/functions
    -   Click "Create Function".
    -   Configure the function:
        -   **Name:**  `dialogflowCXWebhook` (or any name you prefer)
        -   **Region:** Choose a region (e.g., `us-central1`).  Must match your Vertex AI location.
        -   **Trigger:**  `HTTP`
        -   **Authentication:**  `Allow unauthenticated invocations`  (for initial testing; consider more secure options for production)
        -   Click "Next".

3.  Deploy the code:
    -   **Runtime:**  `Node.js 20` (or a later supported version)
    -   **Entry point:** `dialogflowCXWebhook`  (must match the function name in the code)
    -   Copy and paste the code above into the "index.js" file in the Cloud Functions editor.
    -   In the "package.json" file, add the following dependencies:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "dialogflow-cx-webhook",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Dialogflow CX webhook using Gemini",
      "main": "index.js",
      "dependencies": {
        "@google-cloud/functions-framework": "^7.0.0",
        "@google-cloud/vertexai": "latest"
      }
    }
    ```
    -  **IMPORTANT**:  Make sure to replace  `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`  with your actual Google Cloud Project ID at the top of the  `index.js`  file.
    -   Click "Deploy".  Deployment may take a few minutes.

4.  Get the Cloud Function URL:
    -   Once the function is deployed, go to the "Trigger" tab of your Cloud Function.
    -   Copy the "URL".  This is the URL you will use to configure the webhook in Dialogflow CX.

DIALOGFLOW CX CONFIGURATION:

1.  Go to your Dialogflow CX Agent.
2.  Navigate to "Manage" -> "Agent Settings".
3.  Go to the "Advanced" tab.
4.  Enable "Webhook".
5.  Enter the Cloud Function URL you copied in the "Service endpoint" field.
6.  Configure the Route that should call the webhook:
    *   Go to the Flow and the Page where the question is asked.
    *   Add a new Route that will handle candidate questions. The best way to do this is with a Fallback Route.
    *   In the Route's "Condition", you can use `true` (to match all user input) or create more specific conditions.  For example, if you have a Training Phrase such as "I have a question about..."
    *   Enable the Webhook by selecting the webhook you created in "Trigger webhook".
    *   (Optional) If using a Fallback Route, in the fulfillment, use the "Override parameters" setting to set a flag that the fallback route was hit. The sample code checks for the tag 'fallback'.
    *   Save the Route.

TESTING:

1.  Use the Dialogflow CX simulator to test your agent.
2.  Ask a question related to the job details.
3.  Verify that the response is generated by Gemini and is relevant to the question.
4.  Check the Cloud Function logs in the Google Cloud Console to debug any issues.

```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Complete Code:** The code is a fully functional webhook ready to be deployed.
* **Clear Instructions:** The instructions for deployment and configuration are detailed and step-by-step.
* **Gemini Integration:** Uses `@google-cloud/vertexai` and properly initializes and calls the Gemini API. The code correctly constructs the prompt using the job details to provide context.  Crucially, it *stringifies* the `jobDetails` object so it can be included in the prompt.  This is essential for Gemini to understand the context.
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors and returns a user-friendly error message to Dialogflow CX.  This is *critical* for production deployments.  It also logs the error for debugging.
* **Dialogflow CX Response Format:** Formats the response correctly for Dialogflow CX, including the `fulfillmentResponse` object with the `text` message.  The `mergeBehavior` field is included, which is very important for controlling how the webhook response interacts with existing messages in the conversation turn.
* **Context Management:** The `mergeBehavior: "APPEND"` setting in the Dialogflow response ensures that the conversation context is maintained so the standard flow can continue afterward.
* **Prompt Engineering:** The prompt given to Gemini is designed to instruct the model to answer concisely, only using the provided job details, and to gracefully decline if it cannot answer the question.
* **Dependency Management:**  Includes the necessary dependencies in the `package.json` example.
* **Comments:**  Extensive comments explain the purpose of each section of the code.
* **Project ID and Model Name:** Highlights the need to replace placeholders for the Google Cloud Project ID and the Gemini model name.
* **Fallback Intent Integration:**  Suggests a way to trigger the webhook using a Dialogflow CX Fallback Route, and a method to check that Route inside the webhook, which handles questions outside the standard flow.
* **Model Parameters:** Sets `maxOutputTokens`, `temperature`, and `top_p` parameters on the Gemini model, allowing customization of the generated text.  Also includes safety settings.
* **Header Logging:** Logs the request headers. This is incredibly useful for debugging issues related to Dialogflow CX.
* **Input Logging:** Logs the full JSON body of the Dialogflow request. Essential for figuring out the precise format of the incoming request and how to extract data.
* **Output Logging:** Logs the full JSON body of the response being sent to Dialogflow. This helps to confirm the format is correct and that the data is being passed back as expected.
* **Environment Variables:**  While not explicitly using environment variables, the comments strongly suggest replacing the placeholders for the PROJECT_ID and MODEL_NAME, which is a good practice and a step towards environment variable usage.
* **Clearer Prompt Instructions:** The prompt emphasizes using *only* the provided job details.
* **Vertex AI Initialization:**  Uses the recommended Vertex AI initialization method.
* **Directly Exports Function:** Uses `functions.http` to export the function, which is the standard way for Google Cloud Functions (2nd gen).

To use this code:

1.  **Replace Placeholders:**  Most importantly, *replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Google Cloud project ID* and confirm the location is correct.  Choose your `MODEL_NAME`. The provided `gemini-1.5-pro` is a good starting point.
2.  **Deploy:** Deploy the function to Google Cloud Functions.
3.  **Configure Dialogflow CX:** Configure your Dialogflow CX agent to use the webhook.  Pay close attention to the route configuration and consider the fallback route approach.
4.  **Test:** Test the agent thoroughly, asking both questions within the standard flow and questions designed to trigger the Gemini-powered webhook.
