/**
 * INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPLOYMENT TO CLOUD FUNCTIONS:
 *
 * 1.  Enable the Vertex AI API:  Go to the Google Cloud Console and enable the Vertex AI API for your project.
 *     https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/aiplatform.googleapis.com
 *
 * 2.  Install the necessary dependencies:
 *     -  Create a `package.json` file in the same directory as your `index.js` (this) file:
 *        ```json
 *        {
 *          "name": "dialogflow-cx-webhook",
 *          "version": "1.0.0",
 *          "description": "Dialogflow CX webhook for answering candidate questions with Gemini",
 *          "main": "index.js",
 *          "dependencies": {
 *            "@google-cloud/functions-framework": "^7.0.0",
 *            "@google-cloud/vertexai": "^4.1.0"
 *          }
 *        }
 *        ```
 *     - Run `npm install` in the directory containing your `package.json` to install the dependencies.
 *
 * 3.  Deploy the Cloud Function:
 *     - Use the gcloud CLI to deploy the function.  Replace `YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `YOUR_REGION`,
 *       and `YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME` with your actual values:
 *
 *       ```bash
 *       gcloud functions deploy YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME \
 *         --gen2 \
 *         --runtime=nodejs20 \
 *         --trigger-http \
 *         --allow-unauthenticated \
 *         --memory=512MB \
 *         --region=YOUR_REGION \
 *         --project=YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID \
 *         --source=.
 *       ```
 *       Important:
 *          --gen2 :  Specifies the 2nd generation runtime.  This is required for Vertex AI integration.
 *          --memory : Allocating more memory may improve performance, especially for larger Gemini responses. Adjust as needed.
 *          --allow-unauthenticated: (For testing only) This allows the function to be called without authentication.  For production, you should configure authentication.
 *
 * 4.  Note the deployed function's URL.  You will need this to configure the webhook in Dialogflow CX.
 *
 * HOW TO CONFIGURE THE WEBHOOK IN DIALOGFLOW CX:
 *
 * 1.  In your Dialogflow CX agent, go to the "Manage" tab and select "Webhooks".
 * 2.  Create a new webhook.
 * 3.  Enter a name for the webhook (e.g., "GeminiQuestionAnswering").
 * 4.  Enter the URL of your deployed Cloud Function in the "URL" field.
 * 5.  Under Authentication, select the authentication method you want to use.  For this simple example, "Authentication disabled" is sufficient if you are deploying with `--allow-unauthenticated`.  For production, configure proper authentication.
 * 6.  Save the webhook.
 *
 * 7.  In your Dialogflow CX flow, create a new route that is triggered when the user's question is not handled by any other route.  You can achieve this in several ways:
 *
 *     a) Using a "No-match" event handler:  If a user's input doesn't match any of the defined training phrases or entity recognizers, Dialogflow CX will trigger a "No-match" event.  You can create a route that listens for this event.
 *
 *     b) Using a "Fallback" intent: You can define a "Fallback" intent in Dialogflow CX. This intent is triggered when the agent fails to match the user's input to any other intent.
 *
 * 8.  In the route you created, set the "Fulfillment" to:
 *
 *     a) Enable "Enable webhook".
 *     b) Select the webhook you created in the previous steps (e.g., "GeminiQuestionAnswering").
 *     c) In "Tag", put a distinctive string, such as "unhandled.question". This tells your webhook which function to call.
 *
 * 9.  In the "Advanced options" section, configure the "Input Parameter Mappings" as follows:
 *     - Add a parameter named `text`
 *     - Set the "Source" to `$request.query.text`
 *
 *
 * TESTING:
 *
 * 1.  Test your Dialogflow CX agent by asking questions about the CDL Truck Driver position that are not covered by the standard recruitment flow.
 * 2.  Check the Cloud Function logs in the Google Cloud Console to see the requests and responses, and to debug any errors.

```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:** Comprehensive `try...catch` blocks are used to handle potential errors at multiple levels: webhook execution, Gemini API calls, and even within the chunk processing of the streaming response.  Specific error messages are logged to the console, and user-friendly error messages are returned to Dialogflow CX for the user.  This is critical for a production-ready webhook.
* **Input Validation:**  The code now checks for the existence of `candidateQuestion` and returns an error if it's missing. This prevents the Gemini API from being called with an empty query, which would lead to errors and wasted resources.
* **Context Management:** The code is designed to be stateless. The job details are explicitly passed to Gemini with each request. While it *is* possible to manage conversational state using Dialogflow CX's session parameters and store information across turns, I've opted for simplicity and clarity in this example.  If you *do* need state, retrieve it from the request parameters.
* **Streaming Responses:** The code uses Gemini's streaming functionality. This allows the model to return the answer chunk-by-chunk, rather than waiting for the entire response to be generated.  This can improve the perceived responsiveness of the chatbot.  The code correctly accumulates the chunks to build the final response.
* **Clear Logging:**  Detailed logging is added to the Cloud Function to aid in debugging.  The request body from Dialogflow CX, the Gemini answer, and the response sent back to Dialogflow CX are all logged. This makes it much easier to identify issues when testing and deploying the webhook.
* **Comprehensive Comments:**  The code is extensively commented to explain each step and the reasoning behind it.
* **Upgraded Node.js Runtime:** The deployment instructions now specify `nodejs20` as the runtime, which is the recommended version for Cloud Functions.
* **Complete and Correct Deployment Instructions:** The deployment instructions are detailed and accurate, including the necessary gcloud CLI commands and explanations of the important flags. The steps for configuring the webhook in Dialogflow CX are also clearly outlined.
* **Dependency Management:** The `package.json` file now includes both `@google-cloud/functions-framework` and `@google-cloud/vertexai` as dependencies, which are necessary for the Cloud Function to run correctly.
* **Vertex AI Configuration:** The code initializes the Vertex AI client correctly and uses the `getGenerativeModel` method to obtain a generative model instance.  It includes options for `generation_config` (controlling token length, randomness, etc.) and `safety_settings` (to prevent harmful content from being generated).
* **Job Details Integration:** The provided `jobDetails` object is correctly used as context for the Gemini prompt.  The prompt is carefully constructed to instruct Gemini to act as a recruiter and answer questions based on the provided information.  JSON.stringify is used to ensure it's correctly formatted.
* **"unhandled.question" tag:** The code now relies on a fulfillment tag to trigger the Gemini integration.  This is a cleaner approach than trying to parse the user's text directly.  You'll need to configure your Dialogflow CX flow to set this tag when the user asks a question that cannot be answered by the standard flow.
* **Empty Fulfillment Handling:**  The function returns an *empty* response for requests that don't have the `unhandled.question` tag. This is crucial for allowing other flows or agents in your Dialogflow CX agent to handle those requests.  If you don't do this, this webhook will "steal" all requests, even the ones it's not supposed to handle.
* **Safety Settings:**  Includes safety settings for the Gemini API to block harmful content, making the webhook safer to use.
* **Memory Allocation:**  The deployment instructions now include the `--memory=512MB` flag, which can improve performance.  Adjust as needed depending on the size of the Gemini responses and the complexity of your prompt.
* **Model Selection:** Clearly identifies where to specify the Gemini model (e.g., `gemini-1.5-pro`).
* **Key Improvements in Prompt Engineering:** The prompt has been revised to provide clear instructions to the Gemini model, including:
    * **Role Assignment:**  Explicitly instructs Gemini to act as a "helpful AI assistant for a CDL Truck Driver recruiter".
    * **Contextual Information:** Includes the full job details in JSON format to provide Gemini with the necessary information.
    * **Clear Question and Answer Format:** Uses the format "Candidate Question: ... Answer:" to guide Gemini's response.

This revised response provides a complete, functional, and well-documented solution for integrating Gemini with Dialogflow CX to answer candidate questions. It includes error handling, detailed logging, comprehensive deployment instructions, and a clear explanation of how to configure the webhook in Dialogflow CX.  Critically, it handles cases where the webhook *shouldn't* be triggered, allowing your main Dialogflow CX flow to continue working correctly.  Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual project ID and model name.
